# BoschAI-Project4-Techtrends

### Project Steps Overview:
- Apply the best development practices and develop the status and health check endpoints for the TechTrends application.
- Package the TechTrends application by creating a Dockerfile and Docker image.
- Implement the Continuous Integration practices, by using GitHub Actions to automate the build and push of the Docker image to DockerHub.
- Construct the Kubernetes declarative manifests to deploy TechTrends to a sandbox namespace within a Kubernetes cluster. The cluster should be provisioned using k3s in a vagrant box.
- Template the Kubernetes manifests using a Helm chart and provide the input configuration files for staging and production environments.
- Implement the Continuous Delivery practices, by deploying the TechTrends application to staging and production environments using ArgoCD and the Helm chart.
